## Technologie

For our server we choose to built it in Nest js a progressive back end framework\
For our database we choose to use MongoDB a no sql DB\
The server was built following a microservice architecture with one database per service and one app per service \
Our server use an hybrid communication tools:
- GRPc for architecture microservice:
  - Efficient for a clean architecture and great speed performance
- TCP for service microservice:
  - Efficent for genericity
