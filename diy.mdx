A dockerfile will be created with the script you will only need to update the `dockercompose.yml` at the root of the project

step 4. Dependencies

A secret file will be generated in the secret directory if you need any secret

step 5. Database

OctoaArea use mongodb for our DB but you are free to use the one of your choice as long that you are following our norme
